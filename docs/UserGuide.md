# MeetCLI User Guide

MeetCLI is a **desktop app for managing contacts and meetings, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, MeetCLI can get your contact and meeting management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

**Target Users**: Property agents, sales professionals, and business developers who need to manage large contact lists with company affiliations, tags, and meeting schedules.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g., `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `‚Ä¶`‚Äã after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g., `[t/TAG]‚Ä¶‚Äã` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g., if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `listtag`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g., if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

**Parameter Prefixes:**
* `n/` - Name
* `p/` - Phone number
* `e/` - Email
* `a/` - Address
* `c/` - Company
* `m/` - Meeting
* `t/` - Tag
* `o/` - Notes/Observations (for future commands)

![help message](images/helpMessage.png)

Format: `help`


### Adding a person: `add`

Adds a person to the address book with optional company, meeting, and tag information.

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tips:**

* Use descriptive meeting text like "Project review on Monday 2pm"
</box>

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Important:**
* All tags used must already exist in the tag registry. If you get an error like "Cannot add person with invalid tag", use `addtag t/TAGNAME` first, then retry the `add` command.
* Use `listtag` to see available tags.
</box>

Examples:
* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` - Adds John Doe with only required fields

### Editing a person: `edit`

* At least one optional field must be provided
* All fields are optional but you must specify at least one to edit

**Behavior:**
* Existing values will be updated to the input values
* When editing tags, ALL existing tags are replaced (not cumulative)
* To clear a field, provide the prefix without a value (e.g., `c/` clears company, `t/` clears all tags)

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tips:**
* Use `list` or `find` first to see the index numbers
* To add a tag, it must exist in the registry. Use `addtag t/TAG` first if needed
* You can edit multiple fields in one command

</box>

### Locating persons: `find`

Finds persons by name keywords, tags, and/or company. You can use any combination of these criteria.

Format: `find [KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]...] [t/TAG [t/TAG]...] [c/COMPANY [c/COMPANY]...]`

**Name Search:**
* Case-insensitive substring match. e.g., `han` will match `Hans`
* Multiple keywords use OR logic. e.g., `Hans Bo` returns contacts matching `Hans` OR `Bo`

**Tag Search:**
* Exact, case-sensitive match
* Multiple `t/` use AND logic. e.g., `t/client t/vip` returns contacts with BOTH tags

**Company Search:**
* Case-insensitive substring match
* Multiple `c/` use OR logic. e.g., `c/Google c/Microsoft` returns contacts at Google OR Microsoft

**Mixed Criteria:**
* When using multiple types (name, tags, company), all criteria must be satisfied (AND logic)
* Example: `find alice t/client c/Google` returns contacts named Alice who are tagged as client AND work at Google

Examples:
* `find John` returns `john` and `John Doe`
* `find alex david` returns `Alex Yeoh`, `David Li`
* `find t/client` returns all contacts tagged as client

![Clear Command](images/ClearCommand.png)

### Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`

### Saving the data

AddressBook data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

AddressBook data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous MeetCLI home folder.

**Q**: Can I add custom tags?<br>
**A**: Yes! Use the `addtag t/TAGNAME` command to add new tags to the allowed tag list. Once added, you can use them in `add` and `edit` commands.

**Q**: How do I see all the tags I've created?<br>
**A**: Use the `listtag` command to see all tags currently in use, along with how many contacts have each tag.

**Q**: Can I search for multiple companies at once?<br>
**A**: Yes! Use `find c/COMPANY1 c/COMPANY2` to find contacts at either company (OR logic).

**Q**: What happens to my meeting when I mark it as completed?<br>
**A**: The `mark` command (coming in v1.5) will move the meeting to your history. It won't show as "Next meeting" anymore, but you can view it using the `history` command.

**Q**: Can I have multiple meetings for one contact?<br>
**A**: The infrastructure supports multiple meetings per contact (added in v1.4). Full meeting management commands (`addmeeting`, `mark`, `history`) are coming in v1.5.

**Q**: Why can't I use certain tags?<br>
**A**: MeetCLI uses a tag registry to ensure consistency. Only tags in the allowed list can be used. Use `addtag` to add new tags, or check existing tags with `listtag`.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
