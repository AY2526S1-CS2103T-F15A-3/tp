# MeetCLI User Guide

MeetCLI is a **desktop app for managing contacts and lightweight follow-up reminders, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, MeetCLI can get your contact and follow-up planning done faster than traditional GUI apps.

**Target Users**: Property agents, sales professionals, and business developers who need to manage large contact lists with company affiliations, tags, and a concise "next meeting" note.

* Useful for managing clients across multiple organizations

**üè∑Ô∏è Tag System**
* Categorize contacts with tags (e.g., `client`, `vip`, `prospect`)
* Tag registry ensures consistency across your database
* Search by single or multiple tags
* View tag usage statistics with `listtag`

**üìÖ Meeting Reminders**

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g., `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `‚Ä¶`‚Äã after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g., `[t/TAG]‚Ä¶‚Äã` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g., if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `listtag`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g., if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

**Parameter Prefixes:**
* `n/` - Name
* `p/` - Phone number
* `e/` - Email
* `a/` - Address
* `c/` - Company
* `m/` - Meeting
* `t/` - Tag
* `o/` - Notes/Observations (for future commands)
</box>

### Viewing help : `help`

Shows a message explaining how to access the help page.

![help message](images/helpMessage.png)

Format: `help`


### Adding a person: `add`

Adds a person to the address book with optional company, meeting, and tag information.

Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [c/COMPANY] [m/NEXT_MEETING] [t/TAG]‚Ä¶‚Äã`

**Required Fields:**
* `n/NAME` - Person's full name
* `p/PHONE_NUMBER` - Contact phone number

* `t/TAG` - Tags for categorization (can specify multiple tags)

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tips:**
* A person can have any number of tags (including 0)
* Tags must be added to the registry first using `addtag` before they can be used

* Use descriptive meeting text like "Project review on Monday 2pm"
</box>

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Important:**
* All tags used must already exist in the tag registry. If you get an error like "Cannot add person with invalid tag", use `addtag t/TAGNAME` first, then retry the `add` command.
* Use `listtag` to see available tags.
</box>

Examples:
* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` - Adds John Doe with only required fields

### Adding a tag: `addtag`

Adds a new tag to the allowed tag registry, making it available for use in `add` and `edit` commands.

Format: `addtag t/TAG_NAME`

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes:**
* Tag names must be alphanumeric (no spaces or special characters)
* Tag names are case-insensitive (e.g., `Friends` and `friends` are the same)

Format: `listtag`

**Features:**
* Alphabetically sorted (case-insensitive)
* Shows the exact registry view used by `add` and `edit`
* Helpful for checking which tags you can apply or filter by

Example output:
```

```

![List Tag Command](images/ListTagCommand.png)

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tip:** Use `listtag` before using `find t/TAG` to see which tags are available for filtering!
</box>

Note: If the registry is empty, displays `There are currently no tags.`

### Editing a person: `edit`

Edits an existing person in the address book.

Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [c/COMPANY] [m/NEXT_MEETING] [t/TAG]‚Ä¶‚Äã`

**Parameters:**
* `INDEX` - The index number shown in the displayed person list (must be a positive integer: 1, 2, 3, ‚Ä¶)
* At least one optional field must be provided
* All fields are optional but you must specify at least one to edit

**Behavior:**
* Existing values will be updated to the input values
* When editing tags, ALL existing tags are replaced (not cumulative)
* To clear a field, provide the prefix without a value (e.g., `c/` clears company, `t/` clears all tags)

<box type="tip" seamless>

**Tips:**
* Use `list` or `find` first to see the index numbers
* To add a tag, it must exist in the registry. Use `addtag t/TAG` first if needed
* You can edit multiple fields in one command
* Company can be cleared by using `c/` with no value
</box>

Examples:
* `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` - Edits phone and email of the 1st person

![Edit Command](images/EditCommand.png)

### Locating persons: `find`

Finds persons by name keywords, tags, and/or company. You can use any combination of these criteria.

Format: `find [KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]...] [t/TAG [t/TAG]...] [c/COMPANY [c/COMPANY]...]`

**Name Search**

* Case-insensitive substring match (e.g., `han` matches `Hans`)
* Multiple keywords use **OR** logic (e.g., `Hans Bo` ‚Üí matches `Hans` **or** `Bo`)

**Tag Search**

* Exact, case-sensitive match
* Multiple `t/` values use **AND** logic (e.g., `t/client t/vip` ‚Üí contacts that have **both** `client` **and** `vip`)
* **Allowed-tag check:** If any tag is **not** in the registry, **no search is performed** and a warning is shown

**Company Search**

* Case-insensitive substring match
* Multiple `c/` values use **OR** logic (e.g., `c/Google c/Microsoft` ‚Üí at Google **or** Microsoft)

**Mixed Criteria**

* When combining name / tags / company, the groups are combined with **AND** (all must match)
* Example: `find alice t/client c/Google` ‚Üí contacts named ‚Äúalice‚Äù **and** tagged `client` **and** whose company contains ‚ÄúGoogle‚Äù

<box type="warning" seamless>
**Allowed tags only.**  
If you filter with a tag that is not in the registry, the search will **not** run and you will see a message like:  
`Cannot filter by invalid tag(s): friends. Allowed tags: [friend, client, classmate, family, colleague]`  
Use `addtag t/TAG` to add new tags, or `listtag` to view existing ones.
</box>

**Examples**

* `find John` ‚Üí matches `john`, `John Doe`
* `find alex david` ‚Üí matches `Alex Yeoh`, `David Li`
* `find t/client` ‚Üí all contacts tagged `client`
* `find t/client t/vip` ‚Üí contacts with **both** `client` and `vip`
* `find c/Google` ‚Üí all at Google
* `find c/Google c/Microsoft` ‚Üí at Google **or** Microsoft
* `find alice t/priority c/Microsoft` ‚Üí ‚Äúalice‚Äù **and** `priority` **and** ‚ÄúMicrosoft‚Äù

![Find Command](images/FindCommand.png)


### Deleting a person : `delete`

Deletes the specified person from the address book.

Format: `delete INDEX`

* Deletes the person at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list.
* The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, ‚Ä¶‚Äã

Examples:
* `list` followed by `delete 2` deletes the 2nd person in the address book.
* `find Betsy` followed by `delete 1` deletes the 1st person in the results of the `find` command.

![Delete Command](images/DeleteCommand.png)

### Clearing all entries : `clear`

Clears all entries from the address book.

Format: `clear`

![Clear Command](images/ClearCommand.png)

### Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`

### Saving the data

AddressBook data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

AddressBook data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</box>

## Future Work

### Deferred meeting enhancements

During v1.4 we experimented with full-fledged meeting management (commands such as `mark`, `history`, and `addmeeting`). Internal QA revealed that the hybrid implementation was unstable, so we removed those commands for v1.5. The current release intentionally focuses on a **single free-form `m/` field** per contact.

We still plan to explore structured meetings (tracking completion, notes, and history) after the v1.5 release, but only when we can guarantee a stable experience. Until then, keep using the optional `m/` prefix to jot down your next follow-up, and edit it whenever plans change.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous MeetCLI home folder.

**Q**: Can I add custom tags?<br>
**A**: Yes! Use the `addtag t/TAGNAME` command to add new tags to the allowed tag list. Once added, you can use them in `add` and `edit` commands.

**Q**: How do I see all the tags I've created?<br>
**A**: Use the `listtag` command to view the allowed tag list in alphabetical order.

**Q**: Can I search for multiple companies at once?<br>
**A**: Yes! Use `find c/COMPANY1 c/COMPANY2` to find contacts at either company (OR logic).

**Q**: What happens when a meeting is done?<br>
**A**: MeetCLI currently stores only one "Next meeting" note. After you meet the contact, use `edit INDEX m/No meeting scheduled` (or provide a new follow-up) to keep the reminder accurate.

**Q**: Can I have multiple meetings for one contact?<br>
**A**: Not yet. Advanced meeting management commands were deferred to keep v1.5 stable. For now, keep a single concise reminder in the `m/` field.

**Q**: Why can't I use certain tags?<br>
**A**: MeetCLI uses a tag registry to ensure consistency. Only tags in the allowed list can be used. Use `addtag` to add new tags, or check existing tags with `listtag`.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
